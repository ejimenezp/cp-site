		<p>With more land under vine than in any other country, Spain has a lot to offer. It is also the sheer diversity of terroir, climate and grape variety that make Spanish wine so interesting. From mountainous plains to atlantic vineyards, from intense Andalucian sun to cold winters of the north, there is no uniform method for Spanish winemakers. Indeed, Spanish winemakers have very different approaches from very traditional to the more international-style. Then there is the new wave of boutique bodegas, those who value the ancient vineyards and cultivate them with carefully planned modern technology.</p>

		<p>None are the best, all are different and the result is a burgeoning wine industry in Spain that piques the interest of wine-lovers across the world. Our wine-tasting sessions provide an introduction to 6 regions and 6 wines. The evenings in our designated tasting room begin with an introduction to Spanish wine and to general wine tasting techniques.</p>

		<p>Talking you through these wines and regions, the sommelier gives a sensory analysis of each wine looking at the appearance, its bouquet and the taste. Also forming part of the analysis is the terroir, the winemaker and grape varieties.</p>

		<p>There is a lot to cover but our experts will lead the session at just the right pace. You do not need to be an expert, you just need to enjoy wine and want to know more. All sessions are 2.5 hours and are held in English.</p>
