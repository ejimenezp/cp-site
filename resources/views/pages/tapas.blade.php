		<p>Originally from Seville, tapas started out almost by accident. In order to keep the flies off a glass of fino, a tapa (meaning lid) of cheese or ham was used to cover the glass. People got used to it and bartenders would take advantage of the salty, thirst-inducing snacks to sell more drink. It’s also said that it was encouraged to curb drunken behaviour as the food would slow the effects of alcohol.</p>

		<p>Since then, tapas has embarked on a remarkable journey of social mobility. Gone are the saucers of simple olives or boquerones (fresh anchovies) served as a by-product in local bars, tapas is now centre stage and among the most popular and fashionable cuisines in the world with top restaurants to prove it. Tapas is now an art in itself. Of course the classic tapas remain and if you’ve ever wondered how to make traditional Spanish tapas, this is the class for you.</p>
